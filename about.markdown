**Infrequent:** I do not blog much.  Besides, there are many excellent functional programming blogs already. I will commit a post if something really bugs me or I feel very passionate about a topic that is not otherwise covered by people smarted than me.  
It will be about programming, most likely functional programming.  

**Pragmatic:**  My pet peeve is identifying [patterns of erroneous code](/tags/patterns-of-erroneous-code.html) and what could be causing them, there are technical and human factors underlying these patterns.  I particular, I am trying to understand how certain code abstractions could promote erroneous code.  The term anti-pattern has been used for something similar. However, that term is associated with design patterns and this topic is broader.

**About me:**  My name is Robert Peszek. I am currently employed by Juris Futura, Holland and Hart LLP Innovation Lab and work on Haskell backend.     
I also have a long history of mainstream programming work mostly using Java and friends (Groovy, JS, C#, ...).  
My pet projects use Haskell and friends (Idris, Purescript, Elm, Scalaz, ...). I am coding professionally since 1995. 
Before becoming a developer, I have done research work in mathematics in areas related to nonlinear analysis.  
I like outdoor activities, skiing in particular.
